## Reading Group

This is a trainee-led initiative in the [McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health](http://www.mccaiginstitute.com/) to learn statistics.
Our objective is to cover descriptive statistics to hypothesis testing up to general linear models.
Our focus is on understanding the models and their assumptions and working through test cases.

The group is composed of the following core members:
- Bryce Besler
- Andres Kroker
- Danielle Whittier
- David Aponte
- Jordan Bannister
- Leonardo Martin-Alarcon

The group is supported by the following post doctoral fellows and faculty in the institute:
- Dr. Leigh Gabel
